C or C++?

C - char ** which points to each line
open, loads all 'lines' or 4096 bytes into this char * array on heap, can use a current char ** to point to the current line
and make changes

Possible compression using huffman encoding,
min heap will have to be implemented from scratch

C++ - could use same code from C, but with objects as well. Would allow practice for using C++, an arguably more useful language in
the future.

Could perform Huffman coding with existing STL container, 'priority queue'


#TODO

'c' command causing seg fault
